# Complete Edition History of the Onyx Boox Mira 25.3" E-ink Monitor

The Onyx Boox Mira 25.3" monitor line has undergone a clear three-generation evolution, with each new version representing a significant hardware upgrade while maintaining the core "Mira Pro" branding.

## First Generation: Mira Pro Original (2021-2022)

The original **Mira Pro** launched in late 2021 after pre-orders opened in September. This foundational model featured a 25.3" E Ink Carta monochrome display with 3200×1800 resolution at 145 PPI. **Notably absent was any front lighting system** - users relied entirely on ambient environmental lighting. The model code OPC0875R appeared on retailer listings, and the monitor featured BSR (BOOX Super Refresh) technology for improved refresh rates. Connectivity included five ports: HDMI, Mini HDMI, USB-C, DisplayPort, and DC power. The all-aluminum construction weighed approximately 2,750g and included VESA 75×75mm mounting compatibility. Launch pricing was $1,799.99.

## Second Generation: Mira Pro with Front Light (2023-2024)

October 2023 marked the announcement of the second-generation Mira Pro, which began shipping in early 2024. **The defining upgrade was the addition of the MOON Light 2 front lighting system**, featuring dual-tone lights with adjustable color temperature between warm and cold settings. This flicker-free lighting system added approximately 150g to the monitor's weight, bringing it to 2,900g. All other specifications remained identical to the first generation, including the same display resolution, connectivity options, and build quality. Onyx continued marketing this as the "Mira Pro" without a distinct model name change, though it represented a substantial hardware revision addressing the primary limitation of the original model.

## Third Generation: Mira Pro Color (2024-2025)

The most recent evolution came with the **Mira Pro Color**, announced by Good e-Reader in May 2024 and officially launching April 28, 2025. This version replaced the monochrome Carta panel with a **Kaleido 3 color E Ink display** capable of displaying 4,096 colors plus 16 grayscale levels while maintaining the same 3200×1800 resolution. The monitor retained the front lighting system from Generation 2 and introduced enhanced features including four preset refresh modes (Normal, Text, Video, Slideshow), Dark Color Enhancement, and Light Color Filter. Current pricing is $1,899.99.

## Key Technical Evolution Patterns

The research reveals Onyx's systematic approach to product development. Each generation addressed a specific limitation: Generation 1 established the large-format e-ink monitor category, Generation 2 solved the lighting problem that limited usability in various environments, and Generation 3 added color capability for expanded use cases. **All three generations maintained identical core specifications** including resolution, port configuration, and basic construction, ensuring accessory and mounting compatibility across the line.

## Model Naming Conventions and Variants

Contrary to the existence of multiple simultaneous variants, Onyx employed a generational replacement strategy. The company reserved "Mira Pro" exclusively for the 25.3" models while using plain "Mira" for their 13.3" monitors. No basic "Mira 25.3" model ever existed - the line began and continued with the Pro designation. Regional availability initially focused on the Chinese market before expanding internationally, with current color models shipping from Hong Kong warehouses.

## Firmware and Software Support

Unlike traditional e-readers, these monitors utilize companion PC software rather than internal firmware updates. Onyx provides software versions for Windows (both 32-bit and 64-bit), macOS, and Linux platforms. The monitors themselves don't receive firmware updates in the traditional sense, as display management occurs through the connected computer's software layer.

## Conclusion

The Onyx Boox Mira 25.3" monitor line demonstrates a focused evolution through three distinct hardware generations rather than multiple concurrent variants. Each generation built upon the previous model's foundation while addressing specific user needs - from the basic display-only first generation to the fully-featured color model with advanced lighting. This progression from 2021 to 2025 shows Onyx's commitment to iterative improvement while maintaining consistency in form factor and core functionality, making the Mira Pro line a mature option in the large-format e-ink monitor category.
