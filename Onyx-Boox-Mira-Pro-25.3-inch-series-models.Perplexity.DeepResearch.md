This version maintained all original specifications but added the frontlight system for low-light usage[2]. The original model without frontlight remained available alongside the frontlight version[1].

## **Naming and Versioning Notes**
The product line maintained consistent "Mira Pro" branding throughout, with variants distinguished by feature descriptions rather than model numbers:
- Base model: "Mira Pro"
- Enhanced model: "Mira Pro Frontlight Version"[1]
- Color model: "Mira Pro Color" or "Mira Pro (Color Version)"[6][12]

Firmware versioning appears to have been problematic, with versions 9 and 10 experiencing deployment issues and being temporarily withdrawn from public availability[7][11].
