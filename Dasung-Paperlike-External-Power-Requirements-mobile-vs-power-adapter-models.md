To help to understand which Dasung Models are suitable for truly mobile laptop/powerbank powered use, and which require wall power socket for external power adapter.

## Executive Summary

Your experience with the **Dasung Revolutionary 37Hz 13.3" Color** requiring external power is confirmed by official specifications. The "Revolutionary" series (high refresh rate models) indeed require wall socket power, while older HD series models can typically run on USB power alone.

## Power Requirements by Model

### ✅ USB-Powered Models (No External Power Required)

| Model | Size | Power Requirements | Official Source | User Reports |
|-------|------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Paperlike HD** | 13.3" | USB (5V-2A) | Manual states "Power supply USB (5V-2A)" | Users confirm "No power cord needed as it draws power from the USB cord from your device" |
| **Paperlike HD-F** | 13.3" | USB power via Y-cable | Q&A: "they receive power through the included HDMI/USB to mini-HDMI Y-cord" | Review confirms "USB for power and HDMI for data" |
| **Paperlike HD-FT** | 13.3" | USB power via Y-cable | No power cord needed, draws power from USB | Teardown confirms "powered by the micro-usb connection" |
| **Paperlike HD-T** | 13.3" | USB power only | Same as HD series | Same as HD series |
| **Paperlike 3 HD** | 13.3" | USB power only | "No power cord needed as it draws power from the USB cord" | Multiple users confirm USB-only operation |
| **Paperlike Color 12"** | 12" | Single USB-C cable | NotebookCheck: "Connection to a PC and power supply are both via the same USB-C cable" | Confirmed 7.5W USB-C power |
| **Paperlike (original)** | 13.3" | USB cable only | Comparison review: "uses simply a USB cable" | Early review confirms USB power only |

### ❌ External Power Required Models

| Model | Size | Power Requirements | Official Source | Evidence |
|-------|------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Paperlike 13K Revolutionary (37Hz) Color** | 13.3" | External DC adapter | Product listing shows "DC power port" | Newatlas confirms DC power port |
| **Paperlike 13K Revolutionary (37Hz) B&W** | 13.3" | External DC adapter | Same as color version | "The adapter will be included in the shipment" |
| **Paperlike 253 Revolutionary (33Hz)** | 25.3" | External power adapter | Package includes "power adapter" | "connect the power cable and HDMI" |
| **Paperlike Color Revolutionary (33Hz)** | 25.3" | External power adapter | Package includes "power adapter" | Same as 253 model |
| **Paperlike HD Revolutionary (40Hz)** | 13.3" | Likely external | Seller mentions "No power cord or battery is required" but this appears misleading | Higher refresh likely needs more power |

### ❓ Unclear Power Requirements

| Model | Size | Notes | Likely Power Source |
|-------|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Paperlike 103 (60Hz)** | 10.3" | Official page doesn't specify power requirements | Likely external due to 60Hz refresh |
| **Not-eReader 133** | 13.3" | Android-based tablet/monitor hybrid | Likely has internal battery + charging |

## Key Findings

1. **Pattern Confirmed**: All "Revolutionary" series monitors with high refresh rates (33Hz, 37Hz, 40Hz) require external power adapters.

2. **USB Power Limitation**: Dasung Q&A confirms standard HD models can use "a standard USB wall plug adapter for power", suggesting 5V/2A (10W) is sufficient for non-Revolutionary models.

3. **Your Experience Validated**: The Dasung Revolutionary 37Hz 13.3" Color indeed requires external power, contradicting any claims of USB-only operation.

4. **Misleading Marketing**: Some retailers may incorrectly state "no power cord needed" for Revolutionary models, but official specs show otherwise.

5. **Power Consumption Trade-off**: Higher refresh rates (33Hz+) require more power than USB can provide, necessitating external adapters.

## Recommendations for Portable Use

### Best for Laptop/Powerbank Use:
- **Paperlike Color 12"** - Single USB-C cable, confirmed portable
- **Paperlike HD-FT** - Proven USB power, good features
- **Paperlike 3 HD** - Reliable USB power operation

### Avoid for Portable Use:
- Any "Revolutionary" series model (33Hz, 37Hz, 40Hz)
- Paperlike 253 (too large and needs external power)
- Likely the Paperlike 103 60Hz (probable external power need)

## Technical Note

The power consumption difference appears to be related to the refresh rate technology. Standard e-ink displays refresh slowly and can operate on ~10W USB power. The "Revolutionary" high-refresh technology requires significantly more power to achieve 33Hz+ refresh rates, exceeding USB power delivery capabilities of standard ports.
