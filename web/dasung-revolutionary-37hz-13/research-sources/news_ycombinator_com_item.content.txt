In a nutshell, this would involve shipping any products manufactured in China to the Mexican facility for "remanufacturing." Very risky in normal times, but since DOGE fired a bunch of Customs employees and cut their budget, Customs doesn't have the manpower to police tariff violations like this (which requires detail reviewing the history of every item) so it's effectively a de minimis risk tactic. Ironic, given that the President's budget is dependent on enforcing tariffs...

(I've own an Onyx BOOX Max Lumi for 4+ years now, using an eInk Mobius Carta display (2,200 x 1,650 207 ppi). I'm quite happy with it, but I'm also well aware of its display limitations. For reasonably static text it is indeed excellent.)

I use the Palma for reading lighter books and the Tab Mini C for textbooks. I also have a larger Android tablet for more colorful books though. I'd recommend getting the largest Boox tablet you can comfortably afford/hold. And one with their older stylus. The new ones are moving away from Wacom I think.

All that's different between the screens is a color filter is added as layer during manufacture. With the software changes it knows which pixels to make white or black when combined with the filter to make the desired color. There are a bunch of tradeoffs with this method. Contrast is worse because of the color layer, color has lower DPI too.

They apply a sticker to the screen with little red/green/blue dots aligned to the eInk pigments. Every “pixel” can then be turned black or coloured. It looks pretty washed out, but works.

From what I can tell, the Kaleido display uses a filter on top of a black/white display to show different colors. That's why they can do 300ppi on black/white content, but only 150ppi on color content. The Kindle Colorsoft uses the Kaleido screen, and it's the worst rated Kindle product on Amazon for a reason. For high PPI color e-ink display, the only option today is the Gallery ([https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Gallery](https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Gallery)), and the only product that I know of is the reMarkable Paper Pro (reMarkable call it Canvas color play) which costs ~$600.

Patreon and Discord support channels filled with issues and help requests, being met with radio silence or asking for patience or "an update is just wrapping up", all while just feeding the social networks more 5 second clips of people playing an arpeggiated chord and announcing a second drop.
