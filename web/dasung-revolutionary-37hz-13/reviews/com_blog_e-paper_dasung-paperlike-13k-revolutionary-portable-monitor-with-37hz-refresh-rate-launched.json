The monochrome e-paper display with a resolution of 3200 x 2400 pixels also benefits from Auto-Clear automatic image clearing technology, which ensures quick and effective removal of the remnants of the previous display. This way, you have a clean and fresh new display every time.\n\nThe monitor otherwise continues with the same basic design layout, which includes a thicker portion along the base that tapers off to get thinner towards the top. The thicker portion is also where the ports are positioned, which include a Mini-HDMI video interface, a Type-C interface, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The thicker portion also hosts the DC power port and the speaker + 3.5 mm headphone slot on either side.\n\nThe monitor measures 307 x 251 x 5 mm at its thinnest portion. Further, the monitor also boasts a strong build, thanks to its aluminum alloy construction. It can connect to both a smartphone and a [computer](https://goodereader.com/blog/e-paper/dasung-paperlike-13k-revolutionary-portable-monitor-with-37hz-refresh-rate-launched#). For this, the monitor comes bundled with an HDMI to Mini-HDMI as well as a Type-C to Type-C cable to help you get started right away. This way, you can have a secondary eye-friendly display where you can do most of your reading.\n\nThe Dasung 13.3-inch Paperlike 13K Revolutionary portable monitor can be ordered via [JingDong](https://u.jd.com/OOTXsvx) where it is retailing for 4,489 yuan. That comes to around 618 USD as per current conversion rates.\n\n[![Image 11](https://goodereader.com/blog/wp-content/litespeed/avatar/c598c51a6d3dcebaf197ff99fae8d6b5.jpg?ver=1752235589)](https://goodereader.com/blog/author/sovy)\n\n[](https://twitter.com/iamsovy)\n\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sovan-mandal-76409415a/)\n\n[](mailto:sovy@goodereader.com)\n\n[Sovan Mandal](https://goodereader.com/blog/author/sovy)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nSenior Writer at Good e-Reader|[sovy@goodereader.com](mailto:sovy@goodereader.com)\n\nWith a keen interest in tech, I make it a point to keep myself updated on the latest developments in technology and gadgets. That includes smartphones or tablet devices but stretches to even AI and self-driven automobiles, the latter being my latest fad. Besides writing, I like watching videos, reading, listening to music, or experimenting with different recipes. The motion picture is another aspect that interests me a lot, and I'll likely make a film sometime in the future.\n\n[Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoodereader.com%2Fblog%2Fe-paper%2Fdasung-paperlike-13k-revolutionary-portable-monitor-with-37hz-refresh-rate-launched)\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dasung+Paperlike+13K+Revolutionary+Portable+Monitor+With+37Hz+refresh+Rate+Launched&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoodereader.com%2Fblog%2Fe-paper%2Fdasung-paperlike-13k-revolutionary-portable-monitor-with-37hz-refresh-rate-launched&via=iamsovy)\n\n[Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoodereader.com%2Fblog%2Fe-paper%2Fdasung-paperlike-13k-revolutionary-portable-monitor-with-37hz-refresh-rate-launched)\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoodereader.com%2Fblog%2Fe-paper%2Fdasung-paperlike-13k-revolutionary-portable-monitor-with-37hz-refresh-rate-launched)\n\n[Vote](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoodereader.com%2Fblog%2Fe-paper%2Fdasung-paperlike-13k-revolutionary-portable-monitor-with-37hz-refresh-rate-launched&t=Dasung%20Paperlike%2013K%20Revolutionary%20Portable%20Monitor%20With%2037Hz%20refresh%20Rate%20Launched)\n\n0 Shares\n\n##### You May Also Like\n\n[](https://goodereader.com/blog/e-paper/netronix-is-counting-on-foldable-and-large-e-readers-to-drive-growth)\n\n![Image 13:  - Good e-Reader](https://media.goodereader.com/blog/uploads/images/2025/07/05044806/Readmoo-MooInk-V-Hero-380x200.webp)\n\nNetronix is counting on foldable and large e-readers to drive growth\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Netronix had a tremendous year in 2024, thanks to sales of color e-readers.
