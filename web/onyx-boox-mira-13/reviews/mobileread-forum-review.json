* * *

 Been searching YouTube for months ... awaiting to see if this will be a worthwhile product. I am not associated with the reviewer, but do watch his vids and he always gives a thorough testing/review of the Pros & Cons:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFEiqJzi32U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFEiqJzi32U)

 I already have a Dasung 13.3" HD-FT monitor, but I do need something bigger for my computer needs ... and the 25.3" Mira Pro is to be released "soon", so I'm going to keep an eye out for it ... although the price tag for the Mira Pro is going to be way too much!

Device: Onyx Boox Tab X C Yeah, I got it two weeks ago. Very nice device but it still has problems with AMDGPU systems.

 Additionally, I ordered a Mira Pro. It will be available in January. I am very interested how it will work.

Device: Kindle DX, Yotaphone 2, iPhone7+, Dasung 13.3" HD-FT Monitor, iPad Pro**How much did you pay for the Mira Pro?**

* * *

 The upcoming Dasung 253 is suppose to be ~$2,500.

 I heard the Mira Pro is under $2,000.

 As the Mira Pro does not have touchscreen support, this may be a deal-breaker for me, as sometimes using a mouse on an e-ink screen is challenging. With my finger, I know exactly what I'm "clicking on", as well when needing to pinch-and-zoom, it would be a hassle to then have to bounce back to the LCD screen (of the laptop or desktop), then back to the e-ink monitor.
