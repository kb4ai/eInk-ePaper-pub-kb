Co authored with ChatGPT Canvas: <https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/6877830ab84881919d2e873070343f59>

### Personal Disclosure

I'm personally biased toward the Onyx brand, having extensive experience with their products. However, I've also regularly purchased and used Dasung products to stay at the cutting edge of e-ink technology. I also use these products on Linux without installing any of the closed-source software they provide, so my feedback reflects how the displays perform “as they are” when connected to Linux machines. My daily work involves mostly terminal, coding, analytics, text, diagrams, graph visualizations, PDFs, documentation, and extensive reading. Occasionally, I watch lectures or talks—content very different from action movies ;).

### TL;DR for Newcomers

* Many brands produce e-ink displays, but Onyx and Dasung stand out for computer screens.
* Dasung introduces cutting-edge technology earlier but feels more experimental and less polished.
* Onyx comes later to market but with more mature and refined products.

### Market Overview: Onyx vs. Dasung

**Dasung:**

* Innovative, first to market with latest matrices and high refresh rates.
* Feels like a smaller company, brave to make more experimental products delivering customers newest tech cutting edge experience.
* Slightly less polished products but often highly preferred by early adopters.
* Ideal for users prioritizing newest tech over minor quirks.

**Onyx Boox:**

* Releases new tech later, ensuring greater polish and reliability.
* Preferred for long-term, stable usage with fewer hardware quirks.
* Offers smoother backlight controls and better hardware compatibility, more resolutions/refresh rates, etc. (e.g. display even during booting on my Raspberry Pis/Laptops , while Dasungs wait for perfect matching setup otherwise not display anything or display garbage).

### Current Situation (July 2025)

**Professional Use:**

* Recommend 23.5-inch displays for extensive professional work, as larger surfaces are easier on eyes, reflect more ambient light, and offer better overall comfort.
* Monochrome screens (e.g., Onyx Boox Mira Pro 23.5 inch) have superior contrast, brighter background and sharpness compared to color screens due to fewer layers.
* Color screens are recommended as secondary displays for tasks that require or benefit from color.

**Recommended Products:**

* **Primary:** Onyx Boox Mira Pro 23.5-inch (grayscale, sharper, better contrast).
* **Secondary:** Onyx Boox Pro Color 2024/2025 or Dasung Paperlike Color 253.

### Mobile Setup and Usage

* Preferred mobile option (currently out of stock): **Onyx Boox Mira 13-inch**.
* **Transform Your Laptop Into a Tablet:**
  The Onyx Boox Mira 13" with touch capability lets you turn your laptop into a powerful, portable tablet—ideal for travel, commuting, or flexible office work. Simply adjust your system settings so the laptop doesn’t sleep when you close the lid. You can then close the lid and place the Mira 13" screen on top, continuing to use your machine with full touch functionality. This setup is fantastic for commuting, moving between meeting rooms, reading code or documents on a plane, using an on-screen keyboard for quick typing, or catching up on reading from the couch—all without switching devices.
* **One‑Screen Mobile Setup:** I modified an IKEA BRÄDA laptop support table, cutting it in half so one section props up my laptop and bears the weight of a 13‑inch Onyx Boox Mira™ screen directly atop the laptop display.
* **Two‑Screen Mobile Setup:** Using the same half‑cut BRÄDA support, I built a lightweight balsa‑wood brace with picture‑frame hooks. I screw small mounts into each Onyx Boox Mira 13" VESA hole and hang two screens side by side, creating a secure, portable dual‑display workstation. (File an issue if you’d like a detailed write‑up and photos.)
* *Curious to see how these setups work in practice?* **I’d love to share more!** If you’d like photos, step‑by‑step guides, or just a closer look at any of these solutions, please don’t hesitate to ask—*file a GitHub issue*, or just reach out to me personally if you know me. I’m genuinely happy to put together a write‑up with photos or answer any questions you might have. **Don’t be shy—your curiosity helps me improve these guides for everyone!**

### Lighting and Backlight Features

* **E-ink screens are best with external lighting**—just like reading a physical book. These displays truly shine when used outdoors, on a balcony, or anywhere you have good natural or ambient light. With the right lighting, you get the **BEST EXPERIENCE** both in terms of display clarity and eye comfort.

  * In fact, e-ink screens are intentionally designed for this: the more pleasant, diffuse light you have on your reading surface, the better they look. For home or evening use, I always set up proper lighting behind me to illuminate the display—exactly as I would when reading paper books.
* While it’s convenient that these displays offer built-in backlight, I consider it a "last resort necessity" for situations like commuting, travel, or hotel rooms—when proper lighting isn’t possible. For daily work at home or in an office, I recommend relying on external light sources to unlock the full potential of e-ink technology and protect your eyes.
* Onyx offers adjustable, smooth gradients of blue and warm backlight.
* Dasung provides only binary on/off backlight settings (off/neutral/cold/warm - four options), limiting customization.
* Even both screens offer "warm" light option, apart from gradient I also prefer "warth" of Onyx backlight, but that is personal and subjective, both are great, for me Dasung backligh is often too strong without option to regulate, so on commute and travel I highly prefer Onyx Mira screens.

### Refresh Rates and Performance

* Dasung Revolutionary 37Hz 13" from the Revolutionary series offers an exceptional 37 Hz refresh rate, making it genuinely suitable for gaming and video. As a seasoned ePaper/eInk user, I’m truly impressed by the refresh rate. That said, like all color eInk displays, it absolutely requires plenty of external light to shine—the images look dramatically better with external light compared to the built-in backlight. Still, during travel or commutes, having a backlight—even without smooth adjustment—is a very useful fallback, but it should be considered more of a convenience than the intended mode of use.

* Dasung Revolutionary screens require external power, limiting portability!!!

* Also I am not sure if I like or hate their "magnetic" VESA mount instead of normal screw mounts...

* **Onyx Boox Mira screens are my personal choice for daily work**—especially the Mira Pro 25.3" and Mira 13"—because their refresh rates and responsiveness suit my deep-focused, analytical workflow. I watch a lot of technical talks, work with code, diagrams, and text, and I find the refresh rate more than sufficient, even for video (as long as it's not fast-paced action). These screens feel balanced and portable, with minimal ghosting, and I’m genuinely happy with them for my use case.

* **But refresh rates, ghosting, and the overall "feel" of e-ink screens are highly personal and unlike anything on LCD or OLED displays.** Their refresh rates and resolutions behave fundamentally differently. For example, the Dasung Revolutionary 37Hz offers an incredibly high DPI and the fastest refresh rate in the e-ink world. I’ve tested it, and while it’s genuinely impressive for those who prioritize ultra-smooth motion—like gaming, fast-scrolling, or video—I still personally stick with my Onyx Mira screens, because for my use case, comfort and clarity matter more than the fastest refresh.

* For context, on the Dasung Revolutionary, I actually get the best visual comfort by scaling up (1.5x, 1.75x, or even 2x in X11), and I know several users who absolutely love it—the refresh rate outweighs any drawbacks for them. I highly recommend the Revolutionary 37Hz, If you care most about extreme motion smoothness. For me other factors are priority.

* **It's important to understand that e-ink refresh rates are *********************************************************************************not********************************************************************************* directly comparable to traditional displays.** *LCDs and OLEDs flash whole new frames instantly, giving you sharp, immediate visual transitions.* By contrast, **e-ink/ePaper displays "reprint" the screen by physically moving pigment in microcapsules**—meaning each pixel transitions a bit differently. You’ll also see that e-ink screens sometimes perform "cleanups" to remove ghosting (a phenomenon unique to e-ink). *Different devices offer various refresh algorithms and modes depending on your main usage—so expect these to feel quite different from anything you've used on LCD/OLED.*

* For years, I've watched talks, videos, and presentations—even on much older e-ink screens—with success, but my needs are mostly analytical content, not fast-moving movies or gaming. **Your mileage may vary—so think about what matters most in your workflow.**

* (Side note: I'm just starting to use the new Onyx Boox Mira Pro 25.3" Color. I don't have a firm opinion yet, but it seems promising—if you want an update on this, please leave a GitHub issue!)

### Linux Compatibility and Technical Quirks

* Personally patched \`xinput\_calibrator\` for touchscreen use on Linux; willing to share upon request (as it's messy patch, hopefully one day I will repackage to mainstream, as \`xinput\_calibrator\` needs maintainer).
* Onyx Boox products offer superior hardware flexibility, supporting various resolutions and configurations, often even during Laptop/SBC booting. 
* Dasung screens typically operate at fixed resolution/refresh rates; scaling requires software adjustments (works reliably on X11 if your graphics card can generate exact resolution+refresh rate (e.g. my older laptop can not for Revolutionary); Wayland untested).

### Notable Hardware Quirks

* Dasung screens exhibit odd behaviour: when powered off, waking laptops unintentionally when attached , so I need every night to unplug it from both, laptop and power source (as otherwise it will be doing "cool LED disco flashing decoration, and I want darkness in room - minor but still inconvenience, giving product even more "experimental" project feel).
* Experienced intermittent Intel graphics card issues with Dasung Revolutionary (funny that resolved by reattaching Onyx screens for a moment).
* Dasung products best suited for stable, stationary setups due to these quirks.

### Personal Recommendation and Final Thoughts

* E-ink screens significantly improved my quality of life by reducing eye strain, calming nerves, and promoting deeper focus.
* Less addictive than traditional screens, facilitating healthier deep focus usage patterns.
* Highly recommend Onyx displays for reliable, polished everyday use, especially for commuting and mobile scenarios.
* Dasung is excellent for enthusiasts seeking early adoption of new tech, accepting minor quirks.
* Future reviews may include smaller tablets and devices from Onyx, if requested.

Overall, investing in e-ink screens has been transformative, improving sleep quality, productivity, and personal well-being.
